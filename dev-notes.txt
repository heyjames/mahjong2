just implemented logic to enable disable buttons to discard and draw tiles and includes the logic to accomodate the first player
next up, you should review code and design for future features like pong

Make Pung work in Player.js on function pungController(turn, tileCode)

Just finished getting pung button to only show next to the associated tiles on Player.jsx line 15 return "inline-block".

You can start working on the pung function in App.js, but I think reworking how the last tile is set in the discard pile would be better. Use the last item in array instead of manually setting it.

Got the state to reload to the same state on compile. Got pung to work. Now I need to do setters for managing the Player variables like disabling draw tile button after a pung.

Pung works pretty well but there is redundant code to set their state (setCanDrawTile(false) on every player). I made a loop to execute that function on all players except the current player, since the current player will have its own state management.

You got one type of chow (discard tile is the right-most) working. There is a bug you fixed after git push.
